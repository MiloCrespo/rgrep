# RGREP

A recursive Version of grep that searches through the entire
directory trees. It finds the thing you are looking for. 

Makefile: 
Make sure to add rgrep.c to your user folder, and update your UPROGS
section to include -rgrep\. 

Main Info:
rgrep takes the pattern matching code from regular grep and
adds recursive directory traversal. When it hits a directory,
it opens it, reads all the entries, and recursively searches 
subdirectories. Files get searched using the same line-by-line 
matching as regular grep.

# -V 
Flag: 
Show all lines that DON'T start with a comment '-v'
rgrep [-v] pattern [directory]

Note: 
Implements custom strcat since xv6's user library doesn't have it

Side Note: 
Buffer size: 1024 bytes - Not 512 :'(
